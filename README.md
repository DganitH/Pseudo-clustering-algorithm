# Pseudo-clustering algorithm

The goal of this project is to design and implement a heuristic algorithm for the clustering problem in DNA storage under high error rate from Nanopore sequencing.
My algorithm has two levels:
1- Division according to the index.
2- Division by closeness to existing clusters according to a certain criterion
For a more detailed explanation, see the file 'Pseudo-clustering algorithm- Final Project.pdf'.

## Getting Started

The relevant files in the folder are:

- main.py - The file that contains the clustering algorithm. You should run this file.

- 450indices.txt - The indices that I concatenated to the DNA sequences.
- errors_shuffled.txt - A file with all the noisy copies of all of the sequences shuffled.
- evyat.txt - A file with a list of all the original sequences and below each one of them, the erroneous copies of it.


In order to run the program, You should download the entire folder and run the file main.py.
